    <h3><span>Title: </span>ARUDINO BASED ROBOTIC AGRICULTURAL AND AUTOMATIC  IRRIGATION</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>This Automated seed sowing Agribot has considerable potential to increase productivity. The chassis handles the complete weight of solar panel, battery and the hardware mounted on Agribot which is able to perform each and every operation skillfully and successfully. 
The system is beneficial to the farmers for the basic seed sowing operation. The mode of operation of this machine is very simple even to the lay man.. Low germination percentage leading to wastage of seeds can be reduced by the use of this system. Creation of gap due to non-germination of seeds can be avoided. Total yield percentage can be increased effectively. Labor problem can be reduced. As compared to the manual and tractor based sowing time, energy required for this robot machine is less. Also wastage of seed is less. So this system will be a better option for the farmers who want to perform the seed sowing operation in a well-organized manner.
